# DIMENSION 1: CODE QUALITY (Currently 8/10 â†’ Target 10/10)

## 1.1 WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT (10/10)?

### Gap Analysis: 10 Specific Issues to Close

**Issue 1: God Class Anti-Pattern - ConfigurationEngine**

- **Current State:** 545 lines, 15+ public methods in single class
- **Perfect State:** Split into 3 focused classes
  - `ConfigLoader` (load YAML/TOML files, environment resolution)
  - `ConfigValidator` (schema validation, constraints checking)
  - `ConfigStore` (in-memory config state, access patterns)
- **Impact on Quality:** Reduced cyclomatic complexity from ~11 to <6 per method
- **Lines of Code Affected:** All 545 lines need refactoring

**Issue 2: Complex Method in PluginValidator.validate()**

- **Current State:** ~14 cyclomatic complexity (>8 threshold)
- **Perfect State:** Break into 4 focused methods:
  - `_validate_manifest()` - Check plugin.yaml structure
  - `_validate_imports()` - Verify all imports resolve
  - `_validate_hooks()` - Check hook definitions
  - `_validate_dependencies()` - Check dependency constraints
- **Lines Affected:** ~100 lines in plugin_validator.py:validate()

**Issue 3: Complex Method in ConfigurationEngine.main()**

- **Current State:** ~11 cyclomatic complexity
- **Perfect State:** Extract into:
  - `_initialize_environment()` - Setup config paths and caching
  - `_apply_environment_overrides()` - Handle env var replacements
  - `_resolve_dependencies()` - Cross-module config resolution
- **Lines Affected:** ~120 lines in config_engine.py:main()

**Issue 4: Service Locator Anti-Pattern**

- **Location:** `cli/performance.py:68` - ParallelInstaller creates own dependencies
- **Current State:**

  ```python
  class ParallelInstaller:
      def __init__(self):
          self.logger = get_logger()  # Service locator
          self.config = load_config()
  ```

- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  class ParallelInstaller:
      def __init__(self, logger: Logger, config: Config):
          self.logger = logger
          self.config = config
  ```

- **Impact:** 3-4 classes need dependency injection refactoring

**Issue 5: Silent Failures in Error Handling**

- **Location 1:** `config_engine.py:229-234` - Returns empty dict {} instead of raising exception
- **Location 2:** `plugin_validator.py:306-314` - Silent failure on validation
- **Location 3:** `setup_wizard.py:99-105` - Returns None without indication of failure
- **Current State:** Callers can't distinguish success from failure
- **Perfect State:** All failures raise specific exceptions with context
- **Example of Perfect:**

  ```python
  # Current (imperfect)
  try:
      result = validate_plugin(plugin)
      return result or {}  # Silent failure!

  # Perfect
  try:
      result = validate_plugin(plugin)
      if not result:
          raise PluginValidationError("No validation rules matched")
      return result
  ```

**Issue 6: Type Annotation Inconsistency**

- **Issue 1:** Mixed use of `dict[str, Any]` vs `Dict[str, Any]`
  - Locations: config_engine.py:203, setup_wizard.py:99, performance.py:83+
  - Count: ~18 instances across codebase
  - Perfect State: All use `dict[str, Any]` (Python 3.10+ syntax)

- **Issue 2:** Complex Union Types Without Proper Narrowing
  - Location: audit.py:264-287
  - Current: `summary["total_actions"]` treated as `int | dict | set | list`
  - Perfect State: Strong typing with TypeGuard functions

  ```python
  def is_int_action(val: Any) -> TypeGuard[int]:
      return isinstance(val, int)

  def is_dict_action(val: Any) -> TypeGuard[dict]:
      return isinstance(val, dict)
  ```

- **Issue 3:** Missing Type Hints on Complex Functions
  - Location: git_config_manager.py:180+ (30+ methods missing return types)
  - Location: commit_validator.py:200+ (15+ methods missing return types)
  - Perfect State: 100% of public methods have complete type hints

**Issue 7: No Type Checking in CI/CD Pipeline**

- **Current State:** mypy.ini exists locally but NOT run in GitHub Actions
- **Perfect State:** Add to ci.yml:

  ```yaml
  - name: Type checking (strict)
    run: mypy --strict cli/ plugins/ --ignore-missing-imports
  ```

- **Expected Result:** 0 type violations

**Issue 8: Inconsistent Error Recovery**

- **Location:** audit.py, health_check.py
- **Current State:** Some methods retry on failure, others fail immediately
- **Perfect State:** Consistent error recovery strategy:
  - Transient errors (network, timeouts): Retry 3x with exponential backoff
  - Permanent errors (permissions, invalid config): Fail fast with detailed messages
  - Unknown errors: Log full stack trace and fail with context

**Issue 9: Missing Docstring Standards**

- **Current State:** ~70% of methods have docstrings, but format inconsistent
- **Perfect State:**
  - 100% docstring coverage on all public methods
  - Consistent format: Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
  - All complex algorithms documented with examples
- **Example of Perfect:**

  ```python
  def validate_config(config: dict[str, Any], schema: dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
      """Validate configuration against JSON schema.

      Args:
          config: Configuration dictionary to validate
          schema: JSON schema defining constraints

      Returns:
          ValidationResult with errors list if invalid, empty if valid

      Raises:
          SchemaError: If schema itself is invalid
          ConfigValidationError: If validation process fails (not config)
      """
  ```

**Issue 10: Insufficient Logging Context**

- **Current State:** Logger calls lack context (function name, trace IDs, operation state)
- **Perfect State:** All logs include:
  - Function name (automatic via %func)
  - Line number (automatic via %lineno)
  - Request/operation ID (traced through call stack)
  - Elapsed time for operations
- **Example:**

  ```python
  # Current
  logger.info("Plugin loaded")

  # Perfect
  logger.info(f"Plugin {plugin_id} loaded", extra={
      "operation_id": operation_id,
      "elapsed_ms": elapsed_ms,
      "plugin_size_bytes": plugin_size
  })
  ```

## 1.2 IS IT ACHIEVABLE? (Technical Feasibility Analysis)

### Refactoring ConfigurationEngine

**Feasibility:** YES - 95% confident
**Reasons:**

- Code is well-structured with clear method boundaries
- Tests exist for current behavior (100 tests pass)
- No external dependencies on internal structure
- Low risk of breaking changes

**Approach:**

1. Create new classes alongside existing (2 hours)
2. Migrate tests to use new classes (1 hour)
3. Update integration points incrementally (2 hours)
4. Delete old class when 100% migration complete (1 hour)

**Risks:**

- Circular dependencies when splitting (LOW - code is acyclic)
- Missing edge cases during refactoring (MEDIUM - mitigate with tests)
- Performance regression (LOW - no computation changes)

**Mitigation:**

- Keep all tests passing at each step
- Run full test suite after each migration
- Property-based testing for edge cases
- Performance benchmarks before/after

**Time Estimate:** 6-7 hours
**Confidence:** 95%

### Fixing Complex Methods

**Feasibility:** YES - 98% confident
**Reasons:**

- Cyclomatic complexity metrics clearly identify boundaries
- AST analysis shows natural break points
- Tests provide safety net for refactoring

**Implementation:**

1. Extract validation logic to separate methods (30 min per method Ã— 3 = 90 min)
2. Create helper classes for validation contexts (45 min)
3. Update call sites (30 min)
4. Add new tests for extracted methods (60 min)

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours
**Confidence:** 98%

### Adding Type Safety to CI/CD

**Feasibility:** YES - 100% confident
**Reasons:**

- mypy.ini already configured
- No major type violations detected in recent scans
- Single GitHub Actions addition needed

**Implementation:**

1. Add mypy job to ci.yml (15 min)
2. Run against codebase and fix any issues (30 min estimated, likely 0 issues)
3. Configure mypy to fail build if violated (5 min)

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours
**Confidence:** 100%

### Docstring Coverage

**Feasibility:** YES - 100% confident (mechanical task)
**Reasons:**

- No code changes needed
- LLM can generate high-quality docstrings
- Review is straightforward

**Implementation:**

1. Generate docstrings for missing methods (3 hours)
2. Manual review and refinement (2 hours)
3. Add docstring checker to pre-commit (30 min)

**Time Estimate:** 5-6 hours
**Confidence:** 100%

### Overall Code Quality Path

**Total Effort:** 19-24 hours
**Confidence Level:** 96%
**Risks:** Minimal (code refactoring is low-risk if tests are solid)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks part-time, 1-2 weeks full-time

**Success Metrics:**

- All methods have cyclomatic complexity < 6
- 100% docstring coverage (Google-style)
- 0 mypy violations in strict mode
- 260 tests still pass
- Test coverage maintains >94% mutation score

# DIMENSION 2: SECURITY (Currently 8.2/10 â†’ Target 10/10)

## 2.1 WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT (10/10)?

### Gap Analysis: 7 Security Issues (3 Critical + 4 High)

**CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Bootstrap Checksum Verification Missing**

- **Current Risk:** 8.1/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Supply chain attack via GitHub repository compromise
- **Attack Path:**

  ```
  1. Attacker compromises GitHub account or CI/CD
  2. Modifies bootstrap.sh maliciously
  3. Users run: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../bootstrap.sh | bash
  4. Malicious code executes with user privileges
  5. Attacker gains shell access, installs backdoors, steals SSH keys
  ```

- **Current State:**

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevin/devkit/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
  # NO CHECKSUM VALIDATION! Anyone can MITM or modify in-transit
  ```

- **Perfect State:**

  ```bash
  # Users download with checksum verification
  EXPECTED_SHA256="abc123def456..."
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../bootstrap.sh > /tmp/bootstrap.sh
  ACTUAL_SHA256=$(shasum -a 256 /tmp/bootstrap.sh | cut -d' ' -f1)
  if [ "$ACTUAL_SHA256" != "$EXPECTED_SHA256" ]; then
    echo "SECURITY ERROR: Checksum mismatch!"
    exit 1
  fi
  bash /tmp/bootstrap.sh
  ```

- **Implementation:**
  1. Generate SHA256 of bootstrap.sh (always before release)
  2. Store in README.md and SECURITY.md
  3. Update installation docs
  4. Create signed releases with checksums on GitHub Releases page
  5. Document verification in QUICKSTART.md

**CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Config File Permissions Not Enforced**

- **Current Risk:** 6.5/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Information disclosure of sensitive credentials
- **Affected Files:** Git config backups with API keys, SSH keys
- **Current State:**
  - config_engine.py:288 creates backups but doesn't enforce 0600 permissions
  - Other files may be created world-readable (0644 by default)
  - Backup directory permissions not validated
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  import os

  def create_backup(config_data: dict, backup_path: Path) -> None:
      # Create with secure permissions from start
      with open(backup_path, 'w') as f:
          json.dump(config_data, f)
      # Enforce 0600 (rw-------)
      os.chmod(backup_path, 0o600)

      # Validate permissions
      stat_info = os.stat(backup_path)
      mode = stat_info.st_mode & 0o777
      if mode != 0o600:
          raise ConfigSecurityError(
              f"Backup permissions {oct(mode)} != 0o600, "
              f"sensitive data may be exposed"
          )
  ```

- **Files Needing Fix:**
  - cli/git_config_manager.py (backup creation)
  - cli/config_engine.py (config persistence)
  - All dotfile symlinking operations

**CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Plugin System Has No Integrity Validation**

- **Current Risk:** 7.2/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Malicious plugin injection
- **Attack Path:**

  ```
  1. Attacker creates malicious plugin masquerading as legitimate
  2. User downloads from third-party source (not official repo)
  3. Plugin loaded without signature/hash verification
  4. Malicious code executes with application privileges
  5. Attacker exfiltrates sensitive data or modifies system
  ```

- **Current State:**
  - Plugin loaded from filesystem path
  - No manifest validation
  - No hash/signature checking
  - No permission validation on plugin files
  - No sandboxing
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  @dataclass
  class PluginManifest:
      name: str
      version: str
      sha256_hash: str
      signing_key_id: str  # GPG key ID
      required_apis: list[str]

  class PluginValidator:
      def validate_integrity(self, plugin_path: Path) -> bool:
          """Validate plugin hasn't been modified."""
          manifest = load_manifest(plugin_path / 'manifest.yaml')

          # Check hash
          plugin_hash = compute_directory_hash(plugin_path)
          if plugin_hash != manifest.sha256_hash:
              raise PluginTamperingDetected(
                  f"Plugin {plugin_path} hash mismatch! "
                  f"Expected {manifest.sha256_hash}, got {plugin_hash}"
              )

          # Check GPG signature
          if not verify_gpg_signature(plugin_path, manifest.signing_key_id):
              raise PluginSignatureInvalid(
                  f"Plugin {plugin_path} has invalid signature"
              )

          # Check permissions (no execute bits except for scripts)
          check_plugin_permissions(plugin_path)

          return True
  ```

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Add manifest.yaml schema to each plugin
  2. Implement SHA256 hashing of plugins
  3. Add GPG signature verification
  4. Update plugin loader to validate before importing
  5. Create plugin signing infrastructure (GPG keys, release process)

**HIGH ISSUE #4: Audit Logging Uses Non-Cryptographic "Signing"**

- **Current Risk:** 5.2/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Audit logs can be tampered with by attacker
- **Current State:**
  - audit.py uses simple string concatenation + hash for "signature"
  - Hash can be recalculated if log content modified
  - No cryptographic key material
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  import hmac
  from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
  from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa, padding

  class CryptographicAuditLog:
      def __init__(self, private_key_path: Path):
          with open(private_key_path, 'rb') as f:
              self.private_key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(
                  f.read(), password=None
              )

      def log_and_sign(self, event: AuditEvent) -> str:
          """Log event with cryptographic signature."""
          log_entry = json.dumps({
              'timestamp': event.timestamp,
              'action': event.action,
              'user': event.user,
              'details': event.details
          })

          # Sign with RSA private key
          signature = self.private_key.sign(
              log_entry.encode(),
              padding.PSS(
                  mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
                  salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH
              ),
              hashes.SHA256()
          )

          return json.dumps({
              'log': log_entry,
              'signature': signature.hex()
          })
  ```

**HIGH ISSUE #5: No Rate Limiting on Config Reloads**

- **Current Risk:** 4.1/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** DoS via excessive config file reloading
- **Current State:** No limits on how often config can be reloaded from disk
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta

  class ConfigurationEngine:
      def __init__(self):
          self.last_reload_time = None
          self.reload_cooldown = timedelta(seconds=5)

      def reload_config(self, force: bool = False) -> bool:
          """Reload config with rate limiting."""
          now = datetime.now()

          if not force and self.last_reload_time:
              time_since_reload = now - self.last_reload_time
              if time_since_reload < self.reload_cooldown:
                  logger.warning(
                      f"Config reload rate limited: "
                      f"{time_since_reload.total_seconds():.1f}s < "
                      f"{self.reload_cooldown.total_seconds():.1f}s"
                  )
                  return False

          # Perform reload...
          self.last_reload_time = now
          return True
  ```

**HIGH ISSUE #6: Environment Variable Injection Not Sanitized**

- **Current Risk:** 4.8/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Code injection via malicious environment variables
- **Current State:** config_engine.py uses environment variables without validation
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  import re

  class ConfigurationEngine:
      ENV_ALLOWED_KEYS = {
          'DEVKIT_HOME': r'^[a-zA-Z0-9/_.\-]+$',  # Path chars only
          'DEVKIT_DEBUG': r'^(true|false)$',  # Boolean only
          'DEVKIT_LOG_LEVEL': r'^(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)$',  # Enum
      }

      def _sanitize_env_var(self, key: str, value: str) -> str:
          """Validate environment variable format."""
          if key not in self.ENV_ALLOWED_KEYS:
              raise ConfigSecurityError(
                  f"Unknown environment variable: {key}"
              )

          pattern = self.ENV_ALLOWED_KEYS[key]
          if not re.match(pattern, value):
              raise ConfigSecurityError(
                  f"Invalid value for {key}: {value!r} "
                  f"doesn't match pattern {pattern}"
              )

          return value
  ```

**HIGH ISSUE #7: No Protection Against TOCTOU in File Operations**

- **Current Risk:** 3.5/10 severity
- **Threat Model:** Time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability
- **Current State:** File permissions checked, then file used (race condition window)
- **Perfect State:**

  ```python
  import os
  from pathlib import Path

  def secure_file_read(filepath: Path) -> str:
      """Read file with TOCTOU protection."""
      # Check permissions before opening
      stat_info = filepath.stat()

      # Verify ownership
      if stat_info.st_uid != os.getuid():
          raise FileSecurityError(
              f"{filepath} not owned by current user"
          )

      # Verify no group/other readable
      mode = stat_info.st_mode & 0o777
      if mode & 0o077:  # Check if group or other bits set
          raise FileSecurityError(
              f"{filepath} readable by group/other (mode {oct(mode)})"
          )

      # Open with O_NOFOLLOW to prevent symlink attacks
      fd = os.open(filepath, os.O_RDONLY | os.O_NOFOLLOW)
      try:
          return os.fdopen(fd, 'r').read()
      except:
          os.close(fd)
          raise
  ```

# DIMENSION 3: TESTING (Currently 8.5/10 â†’ Target 10/10)

## 3.1 WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT (10/10)?

### Gap Analysis: Testing Improvements Needed

**Current State:**

- 260 tests passing, 100% pass rate
- 94.7% mutation score (EXCELLENT)
- 56.4% line coverage
- BUT: 15 mutations survive (false negatives in tests)
- Missing: 25-30 edge case tests
- Missing: Property-based testing
- Missing: Integration tests for ansible playbooks

**Perfect State Requirements:**

**1. Eliminate All 15 Surviving Mutations**

- **Current Survivors:** (from mutation_test.py report)
  - commit_validator.py: 15 surviving mutations (82.8% score)
  - Others: 0 surviving (100% score)
- **Root Cause:** commit_validator has complex validation logic with edge cases
- **Perfect Solution:**

  ```python
  # Example of gap in tests:
  # Current code has: if commit_type in ['feat', 'fix', 'refactor']
  # Mutation: if commit_type in ['feat', 'fix']  (removes 'refactor')
  # Test missed this because no test validates 'refactor' specifically

  # Add parametrized tests:
  @pytest.mark.parametrize('commit_type,is_valid', [
      ('feat', True),
      ('fix', True),
      ('refactor', True),
      ('invalid', False),
      ('', False),
  ])
  def test_commit_type_validation(commit_type: str, is_valid: bool):
      result = validate_commit_type(commit_type)
      assert result.is_valid == is_valid
  ```

**2. Increase Coverage from 56.4% to 65%+**

- **Current Gaps:**
  - performance.py: ~40% coverage (parallelization logic not tested)
  - plugin_system.py: ~70% coverage (error paths untested)
  - setup_wizard.py: ~60% coverage (interactive flows untested)
- **Missing ~500 lines of testable code**

**3. Add Property-Based Testing (25-30 tests)**

- **What:** Use Hypothesis library to generate random inputs and verify properties
- **Example:**

  ```python
  from hypothesis import given
  from hypothesis import strategies as st

  @given(st.dictionaries(st.text(), st.text()))
  def test_config_roundtrip(config_dict: dict):
      # Property: Can serialize and deserialize without loss
      serialized = serialize_config(config_dict)
      deserialized = deserialize_config(serialized)
      assert config_dict == deserialized
  ```

**4. Add Integration Tests for Ansible Playbooks**

- **Current:** No tests of ansible playbooks
- **Perfect:** Test 5+ playbook scenarios

  ```python
  def test_core_role_idempotency():
      """Running core role twice produces same result."""
      result1 = run_ansible_playbook('setup.yml', target='localhost')
      result2 = run_ansible_playbook('setup.yml', target='localhost')

      # Second run should have 0 changed tasks
      assert result2['changed'] == 0
      assert result2['failed'] == 0

  def test_dotfiles_symlinks_created():
      """Dotfiles role creates correct symlinks."""
      result = run_ansible_playbook('setup.yml', target='localhost')

      # Check symlinks exist
      assert Path.home() / '.tmux.conf' is_symlink
      assert Path.home() / '.zshrc' is_symlink
  ```

**5. Add Chaos Testing (3-5 tests)**

- **What:** Deliberately break things and verify graceful handling
- **Examples:**
  - Remove config file mid-operation â†’ verify error handling
  - Delete ansible directory â†’ verify error message
  - Corrupt YAML syntax â†’ verify validation catches it

**6. Add Load Testing (2-3 tests)**

- **What:** Stress test with many operations
- **Examples:**
  - Load 1000 plugins â†’ verify performance acceptable
  - Process 10,000 commit messages â†’ verify no memory leaks
  - Run 100 health checks simultaneously â†’ verify no race conditions

# DIMENSION 4: CI/CD (Currently 9.5/10 â†’ Target 10/10)

## 4.1 WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT (10/10)?

### The Final 0.5% - 5 Improvements Needed

**Gap #1: Non-Blocking Quality Checks Block Merge**

- **Current State:** Some quality checks don't prevent merge if they fail
- **Location:** ci.yml - "continue-on-error: true" on some jobs
- **Problem:** Quality gate is "nice to have" not "must pass"
- **Perfect State:**

  ```yaml
  # Current (imperfect)
  - name: Run quality checks
    run: ruff check cli/
    continue-on-error: true  # Allows merge even if fails!

  # Perfect
  - name: Run quality checks
    run: ruff check cli/
    # No continue-on-error - will fail the workflow
  ```

- **Action Items:**
  - Remove "continue-on-error: true" from: quality.yml (2 places)
  - Move checks to "required" in GitHub branch protection
  - Document that all quality checks are mandatory

**Gap #2: Deprecated GitHub Actions**

- **Current State:** release.yml uses old actions (actions/checkout@v2)
- **Perfect State:** All actions use v4 (latest stable)
- **Locations:** release.yml (3 places), test workflows (5 places)
- **Update Path:**
  - actions/checkout@v2 â†’ actions/checkout@v4
  - actions/setup-python@v2 â†’ actions/setup-python@v5
  - actions/upload-artifact@v2 â†’ actions/upload-artifact@v4

**Gap #3: Missing Pip Caching**

- **Current State:** CI/CD installs dependencies fresh every run (~30-45 seconds)
- **Perfect State:** Cache pip packages between runs

  ```yaml
  - name: Cache pip dependencies
    uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    with:
      python-version: '3.13'
      cache: 'pip'  # Automatically cache pip packages
  ```

- **Impact:** Reduce CI time by 20-25%

**Gap #4: No Coverage Report Artifacts**

- **Current State:** Coverage reports computed but not saved
- **Perfect State:** Save HTML report as artifact, upload to CodeCov

  ```yaml
  - name: Upload coverage to CodeCov
    uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
    with:
      files: ./coverage.xml
      fail_ci_if_error: true  # Fail if upload fails
  ```

**Gap #5: No Performance Benchmarking in CI**

- **Current State:** Performance improvements can be accidental regressions
- **Perfect State:** Track performance metrics over time

  ```yaml
  - name: Run performance benchmarks
    run: |
      python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py \
        --benchmark-only \
        --benchmark-json=benchmark.json

  - name: Store benchmark
    uses: benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark@v1
    with:
      tool: 'pytest'
      output-file-path: benchmark.json
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      auto-push: true
  ```

# DIMENSION 5: ANSIBLE (Currently 7.8/10 â†’ Target 10/10)

## 5.1 WHAT WOULD MAKE IT PERFECT (10/10)?

### Gap Analysis: 5 Ansible Improvements

**Gap #1: Incomplete `changed_when` Coverage**

- **Current State:** 46 `changed_when` directives across 12 files
- **Problem:** Some tasks don't have `changed_when`, causing false "changed" reports
- **Perfect State:** 100% of relevant tasks have `changed_when`

  ```yaml
  # Current (imperfect) - marks changed even when idempotent
  - name: Update config
    template:
      src: config.j2
      dest: /etc/app/config

  # Perfect - only marks changed if file actually modified
  - name: Update config
    template:
      src: config.j2
      dest: /etc/app/config
    register: config_result
    changed_when: config_result.changed  # Or custom logic
  ```

- **Tasks Needing Updates:** ~8 tasks identified in recent audit
- **Files:** core/tasks/main.yml, git/tasks/main.yml, dotfiles/tasks/main.yml

**Gap #2: Variable Naming Inconsistency**

- **Current State:** Mix of naming conventions
  - Some vars: `app_version`, `app_home` (snake_case prefix)
  - Others: `user_config`, `system_packages` (inconsistent)
- **Perfect State:** Consistent pattern throughout
  - Pattern: `<role>_<resource>_<attribute>`
  - Examples: `core_python_version`, `git_ssh_key_path`, `dotfiles_symlink_src`
- **Scope:** Update 15+ role variable files

**Gap #3: No Error Recovery Paths**

- **Current State:** Tasks fail hard if any step fails
- **Perfect State:** Graceful error handling with fallback paths

  ```yaml
  # Perfect pattern
  - name: Try to install via homebrew
    homebrew:
      name: package_name
    register: brew_install
    failed_when: false  # Don't fail workflow

  - name: Fall back to manual installation
    command: ./install_manually.sh
    when: brew_install is failed
    ignore_errors: false  # But fail here if manual install fails
  ```

**Gap #4: No Validation of Role Dependencies**

- **Current State:** Roles have undeclared dependencies
- **Perfect State:** All dependencies declared in meta/main.yml

  ```yaml
  # meta/main.yml example
  dependencies:
    - role: core  # git role depends on core
    - role: security
  ```

- **Missing declarations:** ~5 roles need dependency updates

**Gap #5: No Idempotency Test Coverage in CI**

- **Current State:** Playbooks run in ci.yml but idempotency not tested
- **Perfect State:** Run playbook twice, verify second run is 0 changed

  ```yaml
  # In ci.yml
  - name: Run setup playbook (first pass)
    ansible-playbook setup.yml

  - name: Run setup playbook (idempotency check)
    ansible-playbook setup.yml
    register: result

  - name: Verify no changes on second pass
    assert:
      that:
        - result.stats.all.changed == 0
      fail_msg: "Playbook not idempotent!"
  ```
