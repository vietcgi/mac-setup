================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Quality Assessment: GOOD for advanced users, INCOMPLETE for first-time users

The documentation is well-researched and comprehensive for developers and
experienced users. Architecture and API documentation are exceptional.

However, the project has a critical usability issue: 5 core files referenced
in the main README do not exist. This breaks the user onboarding experience
and creates confusion.

IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:
- Either create the 5 missing files (recommended)
- Or remove all references and redirect to existing docs

Timeline to Fix Critical Issues: 2 weeks
Expected Quality After Fixes: 8.5/10
