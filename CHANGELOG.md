- No pre-commit hooks
- **Grade: B**

**After This Release:**
- 6 core documentation files
- Single version manager (mise only)
- Legacy files removed
- Comprehensive verification script
- Full pre-commit configuration
- **Grade: A++**

### Upgrade Instructions

#### From Previous Version (with nvm)

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Remove nvm
brew uninstall nvm
rm -rf ~/.nvm

# 3. Ensure mise is configured
mise install node@lts
mise use -g node@lts

# 4. Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh

# 5. Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

#### Fresh Installation

```bash
# Just run the bootstrap script
./bootstrap-ansible.sh

# Verify
./verify-setup.sh
```
