## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I customize packages?

Edit `Brewfile` (base packages) or `Brewfile.sre` (SRE packages), then run:

```bash
ansible-playbook setup.yml --tags packages
```

### How do I change tool versions?

Edit `.mise.toml`, then run:

```bash
mise install
```

### How do I update everything?

Run the update script:

```bash
./update.sh
```

### Can I use this on Linux?

Yes! This setup supports macOS and Linux. See README.md for details.

### How do I uninstall?

Currently there's no automated uninstall. To manually uninstall:

1. Remove installed packages: `brew bundle cleanup --force`
2. Restore backed-up dotfiles from `~/*.backup`
3. Remove directories: `~/.oh-my-zsh`, `~/.config/nvim`, etc.

### Is this safe to run multiple times?

Yes! The setup is idempotent - safe to run multiple times without breaking
your system.

## Need More Help?
